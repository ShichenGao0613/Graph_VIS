review:CX0-6owhNA4k8o6OoaMd9A,Review,,"There isn't decent food late at night in New Orleans. Came here not knowing what to expect, and was in for possibly my most pleasant surprise during my stay. Food was fresh. Service fast. Great seating. Friendly Vibe. And one of the most diverse and unique soda selections I've ever come across. It also has a convenience store attached if you have any other needs. And most important of all it's 24/7!!!! Definitely give it a try especially if youre looking for something late at night."

review:Ok5cBdpQIf94yLDvIgndJA,Review,,"Service: The service here was pretty good. They came within a reasonable amount of time to ask if we were ready and were not annoyed when we said not yet. When we were sort of ready to order we started ordering then asked for one suggestion and went with it. They delivered the food quickly and refilled water whenever needed.

Food: The food is extremely salty to me. I normally eat food that is heavily salted, but even this was too salty to me. We had to get many bowls of rice and ended up still not being able to eat it so we took it home. The taste was pretty good but the Home-Style Tofu that we ordered had vegetables that one wouldn't normally put in the dish--so that was a weird one. Everything else was great.

In the future I will come here again but I would order different dishes. I heard their milk tea is really good but I didn't want to get it because we had a long 4 hour drive home. I'll definitely try it next time."

review:KWl1SNlOEo3g9OnakZk42w,Review,,"An ok place with ok service with mediocre food.   The location is great and I would come back for a beer on the water but not for the food. I got 2 fish tacos, my husband got the burger wrap. I couldn't even finish my fish because it was that bad and I left hungry.  My two year old got the chicken nuggets and wasn't full after eating them all, she asked for more. Basically if the portion is not big enough for a 2 year old who is it big enough for?  We had to track down our server and after we finally did order the wait for the food was over 20 minutes and a couple that came in after us ate before us. The side is potatoe chips, not homemade yummy ones, lays potatoe chips. I'm just unimpressed in general."

review:mvCWLx1Uzs_I4PNSsKJ3JQ,Review,,"I never thought I would enjoy BBQ this much until I tried Jays. My favorite is the brisket, it melts in your mouth and from that moment on you're hooked! I love the pulled pork too, its so tender and juicy and full of flavor. I'm planning on trying the ribs soon. I really think these small businesses know how to do it right. This place deserves more business!"

review:hkyIC93aogd9XUh3j3Uurw,Review,,"After browsing all the great reviews we decided to try Myconos. The food was very good with generous servings. Our one big objection was that we were really pressured to rush through our meal. From the minute we sat down until we were finished our waitress was there asking "" well, are you ready yet?"" I had my husband told her we needed time to read the menu and when we ordered our saganaki she immediately wanted our dinner orders. I told her we really wanted to take our time to enjoy our meal. That didn't phase her at all. Salads came and before we got two bits the entrees were there. The restaurant was not busy, there were plenty of tables. Consequently we will not return there, the competition is fierce and there are several other fine choices."

review:eXCk-54wtQ_z5_JFECwOnQ,Review,,"Today me and the fam visted Hattie B's during our short trip in Nashville. We got there around 3o o'clock. No line at all. But it was raining so that maybe worked in our benefit. The seating is pick your own and of your dinning in they hand you a number and servers will drop your food off to you. The menu is simple only chicken pieces (dark, white, tender, wings) and various levels of spice rub. I ordered the small white in HOT with a side of Mac and greens. My food arrived quick. The chicken was juicy and the right level of spice for me. I have a medium to high tolerance. The Mac and greens were both yummy. A happy break from the spice of the the chicken. You can pick up your own cup on the side and get a cup of water free of charge. Overall a great experience. I would recommend going at an off beat time to avoid the crowd."

review:w7fxCzmEywfsPdpwwjWHXg,Review,,"Not sure why it took me so long to write a review on The Brew Brother's as its been our staple first night dinner for my annual guys trip every Jan.  I happened to stay one night this past week at the Eldo as I had an early flight out the next morning and took my wife as we had been in Tahoe for the week. The Brew Brother's is consistently good and reasonably priced.  They have a large menu of food options and between all of the guys we have tried probably almost everything on it and not been disappointed. As for their beer I'm an IPA snob and their Big Dog IPA is just ok IMO but I still typically get it.  Their wood fire pizza's are solid, burgers, asian chicken salad, french onion dip sammy.....you name it, its good. Its usually pretty crowded on Fri/Sat nights so if you have a big group expect to wait a bit. I believe they also still have live bands play on Sat nights as well. If you find yourself hungry at the Eldorado Reno give it a try."

Foam seems to be more coffee shop than bar, which is all good. There was an array of pastries and a decent menu of small items...spiced nuts, olives, a meat and cheese platter. I had just eaten a late lunch at Urban Eats, and didn't get to try any of the food items, but I will next time.

 I ordered a large French press, and let me tell you, that son-of-a-bitch is large and in charge. I got the whole pot. I'm a fan of Peet's, which I love for its smokiness and depth. The coffee at Foam reminded me a lot of Peet's, and that's also a good thing. The music playing was chill, the atmosphere relaxed, and the staff very friendly. I think Foam will do well (but they do need recycling bins!)"

It also has a very good piece of crawfish bread in the soup.  I had ricotta gnocchi.  It had a fresh corn and summer squash with a pesto sauce.  It was great.  My wife had the seafood platter. It was different from most seafood platters.  It had fried catfish, crab beignets, crawfish bread and marinated shrimp.  It was delicious.  For dessert we had the house made ice cream cookie sandwiches.  This place is definitely a hidden gem on the Westbank."

review:T3Borxd4qJ75v_QudlmnWw,Review,,"Good meat, I had the Gyro Kebab Sandwich, delicious bread, & divine sauces.. The Skhug is my favorite, a spicy cilantro purée.  Belgian fries and quite good, but I really enjoyed the beet fries, spiced just right w/ a little coarse salt.  The menu is simple and not everything is available yet, they just opened.  The drink offerings are limited, but they do offer wine service for a few bucks.  Great eats for takeout or just before going out for the evening. *edit* They are now open for lunch and are expanding hours soon.  The Doner Kebab has become my favorite along with the house salad and the hummus..! Adding that Sixth STAR!!"

review:iqfGODgGO739-UwtpvfGBQ,Review,,"If I could give a negative 100 I would. This one of the most incompetent McDonald's establishments. Their employees don't listen so orders are ALWAYS wrong. Yet they blame the customer' instead of admitting their mistakes. If a short black woman with missing teeth attempts to take your order, go to a different line because she WILL MESS YOUR ORDER UP AND BLAME IT ON THE CUSTOMER. Whoever owns this shitty franchisee needs to do a staff overhaul and find more competent employees. This location WILL NEVER get another dime from me, I refuse to contribute to an incompetent employees paycheck. Fuck this location and their employees, especially that snagglepuss they have taking orders."

review:AfLE_NgwCuP7JQe9rcFj7w,Review,,"So this was an absolutely exceptional meal. As I am currently in town for a conference, I was in dire need to get some quality local food in the city. Walking in I was greeted and guided to my table where my friends were sitting by a lovely hostess. For my drink, I had was a sparkling strawberry which was cool and refreshing. 

For my meal, I ordered the Venison Grillades & Grits which I was told was a newer item on the menu. It was an item that was prepared table side so essentially I received lunch and a little show! The cook walked us through the steps of preparation and explained the ingredients for the meal. Once finished, it was posted and placed in front of me. Presentation - , Taste - ! It was absolutely amazing. I included a before and after of my meal just to show I did not let any of it go to waste! My girlfriends who also ordered, their food came out spectacular as well. They had come to NOLA before and this was my first time. They liked it enough to return and I'll be sure to bring any friends here who travel with me! I'll definitely be raving about this to my coworkers when I return to work on Monday!"

I have had some bar food , wings & nachos ( the guy next me has some and they look fantastic) and it is average bar fair.
This is a nice place and a country themed bar that has line dancing and all the stuff I absolutely hate.
It is really the only bar in the area so I stopped in awhile back for a a happy hour when I was passing bye with a friend.I am glad I did because it is an ok place even though it is a country bar.I actually like some of the songs they are playing , newer country songs so it's actually a different experience.
If you like country this place is for you.

review:SbJjckfO2buvDwm8dzT3sg,Review,,"I went to Applebee's to watch an NBA Playoffs game and enjoy a couple of beers and cheap appetizers. 
First of all, they didn't have the game on television.  In fact, during the later part of the dinner rush, they didn't have any games on tv, just SportsCenter on every television set throughout the bar.  When I asked the bartender if she could put the game on, she seemed put off, as if changing the channel wasn't her job.  I waited approximately 15 minutes for her to figure out how to tune to TNT.
My second issue is that as I walked in, I noticed a sign advertising free mozzarella sticks if I wasn't offered a Corona or Margarita.  Of course, the bartender did not offer either a Corona or Margarita.  When I asked her about it, I was told that this promotion didn't work at the bar, as there were no signs at the bar, but there were signs at every table.  Seems like false advertising to me.  When I left, I looked at the sign again, and it did not state anything about having to sit at a table to be eligible.  As far as I'm concerned, Applebee's owes me mozzarella sticks.
That said, the beers were ice cold and very refreshing.  I ordered an Appetizer Sampler for food, which included boneless wings, spinach-artichoke dip with tortilla chips, mozzarella sticks, and some quesadillas.  All of which were quite tasty.  Also, the hostess was seemingly very nice.  She kept smiling and held the door for me both entering and leaving.
HOSTESS - Kori
BARTENDER - Dawn"

He waited a few minutes for the food to be prepared ( hey, at least it's hot and fresh?)The food was packed in the flimsiest foam container (medium one compartment with a crappy hinge) I've ever seen. The heat of the food had made the container melt and bulge on the bottom. The food was cold ( we live only 5 min from this location) likely due to aforementioned crappy hinges and melted/bulged container doing nothing for heat retention. I can't really even review the food since it was less than lukewarm. Please, please people, invest in adequate carry out containers. Something like 82% of restaurant prepared meals are take out, and it does matter how the food holds up after it leaves your establishment, especially if you desire repeat business."

My brother first introduced it to me when I came back from college over break. So far, I've tried their Mango Shrimp Roll, Spicy King Roll, and Sashimi Appetizer. The Sashimi typically speaks volumes to the quality of the fish and is usually the indicator of taste and overall experience. They start with great quality of fish (sashimi), follow through with fantastic rolls, and finish with a satisfied customer."

I haven't personally stayed here to drink, only purchased a selection of hard-to-find beers, but it's a really cool looking interior, feels like a bar I was in when I went to Prague.

review:JxBklMaB7g_ia-QRkrtxMQ,Review,,"Three stars not 3.5 or 4, we enjoyed our evening......but..... I was expecting more, and here's why. 
 I've had the opportunity to dine several times at the Palm Beach facility and that was a first rate experience. Wilmington not so much. Food was delicious and cooked to expectations but the little things just added up, splatter on plates, spotty silverware, food runners auctioning off food, nothing I hate more than saying ... Mine, hers, right here , no that's hers. C'mon there is only two of us at the table and I'm sure the table has a number and there are seating positions so follow them and please stop auctioning food. 
  Server was a bit late on the initial welcome and took several minutes to get water. **please remember- we were there 2 hours and spent over $200+. That's not a bad night, $100 an hour. Some lawyers don't make that!  
  Service was attentive, polite and execution good but not polished! Sounded like a corporate recording at some points, I had to chuckle. 
   Bang bang shrimp, ceviche and ciabatta loaf with infused EVOO were quite good. Shrimp crispy but lettuce garnish not fresh. Seafood ceviche was citrusy but not offensive.
  My sea bass with truffle butter was excellent and my haricot vert were cooked perfectly. The broccoli rabe although flavorful was tough.... The fibrous ends need to be trimmed more. 
  My wife's entree was the  snapper special with shrimp again executed well and met her expectations. 
  We finished with a pumpkin crème brûlée, a very rich savory pumpkin custard topped I mean burnt (brûlée) with caramelized sugar. Creamy and smooth. 
  A bottle of chard and a coffee, were also part of the meal.
  Now we come full circle... Three employees at the hostess stand and not one said goodbye, thanks, see ya, nothing! We didn't exist to them..... So why should I drop another 200, if in the end it doesn't matter to them...... Thanks for coming have a good night!!"

review:ufdccZ_Tpn-YpLJOVTh9Hg,Review,,"**Update** 
Third time is not the charm... Honestly don't know what I expected this time around. No complaints about the seating got a table pretty quick but came at around 11 PM. Ordered a Miso Ramen with added spicy sauce and poached egg and a Pickled Edamame. The edamame is described as pickled and dressed in a vinaigrette, I expected sharp and tangy tasting pickled edamame but was underwhelmed by a flat cold been salad with large chunks of mushy green peppers and tasteless radish slices. Also got a Miso ramen, but I'd like to describe it as onion soup. The whole soup was hijacked by onions, every bite was filled with al dente white onions, there was definitely more onions than ramen noodles. I would have rather they floated a Gruyere covered crouton and called it French onion soup. My last review was a two star and on top of my above statements the reason why it dropped to a one star was because everyone in the restaurant could care less how we were doing. Never once was I asked how my meal was going or tasted our waitress was too busy dancing around the room and the bus boys were only interested in flipping the tables. They had better customer service the last two times I went, but now they are under a severe deficit of customer service. I really would like someone to take me to the restaurant that they gave a 5 star review, because I MUST be going to the wrong place with the same Ichicoro name and menu. I truly hope this isn't what people accept as GREAT ramen. 
I have been here twice now and both times have had less than stellar meals. The menu and the servers pedal  a beautiful and enticing notion of ramen, but the product that ends up in front of you is lack luster and boring. The menu embellishes a whole lot when it comes to the flavors their ramen is supposed to provide. I've had their house ramen, their shoyu, and a special kimchi ramen. The servers promote a beautiful hunger inspiring description but the flavors they describe are indiscernible in the ramen, fresh citrus flavors in their 15 hour champon broth don't shine through and are muddled and covered by the intense charred taste from the grilled shrimp. The shoyu is so subtle too not very flavorful. The kimchi ramen also underperformed, one would expect a nice kimchi flavored broth with a tang and heat, but it's more like their miso broth with the addition of cabbage and again overpowered by the smokey bacon. The noodles were fantastic, a good textured noodle with nice bite, but they don't produce them in house. I have been twice trying to give them a second chance, but i don't know if I'll make it for a third time when honestly a packaged ramen with your own addition of kimchi would shine a lot brighter than the ramen here."

review:T2fSdeY5PiEWKpLuNfGuIQ,Review,,"Establishments like The Libertine remind me that quality comes at a price.  I wish I had deep enough pockets to be a regular because the drinks are second to none.  This high-class menu can be overwhelming but the bartenders are friendly and very knowledgeable.  The ingredients are fresh and clearly high quality.  The flight of bacon is a must.  It is hard to picture bacon dipped in chocolate sauce as upscale but The Libertine can pull it off.  I was blown away by the oysters with such deep flavors; too bad each one runs $3!  Don't be afraid to try something new, the list of cocktails is seemingly endless."

The food was slightly on the pricier side but might i add worth every penny. You pay for what you get. 
The bakery and restaurant concept is very new and unique. I'm quite a bit of cafe and bakery seeker but so far haven't seen any Greek bakeries around that offer menu items like psomi. 

I came to visit as a result of the reviews of all  the spanakopita pastries and fresh frozen Greek yogurt. PSOMI did not disappoint. I had my first ever baklava latte and baklava frozen yogurt.  it was amazing. My only regret is that now I'm addicted and have to come back ‍‍ lol 

I was not in the mood for lunch but the menu looked amazing so I will have to come back with my boyfriend to try it out. Thank you"

review:AuM0Sbsi4-UXc93qGR_m5Q,Review,,"Jing Fong is either a hit-or-a-miss. My work, usually orders from here once or twice a month and the only item I really like is their Sesame Chicken. Even with that you are taking a bit of a risk.

I can't imagine how unhealthy this place actually is. Everything is greasy or fried. The sesame chicken I usually get is just a thick, goopy orange sauce drenched on top of some fried chicken. Don't get me wrong it's not bad, but you can't taste the chicken. The chicken is really chewy and somewhat hard. I once tried out the fried vegetables and noodles and it was just not good. 

Portion wise it's pretty small and it you will only have enough food for a medium sized lunch.

I have never stopped in before, so I cannot speak on the staff.

Altogether, it is not great, but I will definitely keep ordering it from my work. If I'm ever in the area, I may stop in."

review:N_5OwoNfNd2NIIbiQ4o-1A,Review,,"Cheap food fast. Everyone does it. Good food fast is something that's few and far between. Cookout falls somewhere in the middle for me. 

Walked in and was greeted by Jesus music on the speakers almost as loud as the bars I go to play back home. I guess that's just the south? I digress, goodbye one star. 

The girl behind the counter was more worried about the other guy she was working with and making sure she looked good while flirting to say hello to my party. Whatever. I employ teenagers and know that's mostly all they're worried about. She took our order and it was right, so I'll get over that. 

They have these ""platter"" things that come with a miscellany of odd sides, like a bacon wrap and quesadillas. I partook in the Double Burger, with an bacon wrap and hush puppies as my sides. I also upgraded to a Cheesecake milkshake, and that was an awesome idea. 

The burger was pretty good. A step up from Burger King, but the price point for all the food was only $4.99, so it kind of blew my mind. The sauces were good and the veggies were okay, so their burger was a win in my book. 

Sides were sides. Bacon wrap was weird; two slices of bacon with ranch in a tortilla. Oh, and all the way at the bottom there were like three shreds of cheese. SURPRISE! It's a good idea, but could be executed better. The hush puppies were okay too. They looked like stubby fingers. But, again, I digress. 

If they tone down the Jesus in your face, and the angsty teens, this place would be awesome. But if you're into that stuff, enjoy. 

Happy Eating!!"

Our catered wedding food was terrible and kept repeating (the same 4 vegetarian Indian dishes for lunch AND dinner...) so at least I had this meal to tide me over.

I ordered the fried chicken entree and it came with a small soup, salad, side of fries and 4 pieces of fried chicken! This place had a huge, varied menu and reasonable prices. Service was okay and friendly enough. Quality of food is pretty basic but satisfying if you're hungry, which I was.

review:rk9bhpyPEKUFqBEDp4jATA,Review,,"We were looking for a place to grab some dinner in Northeast Philly and stumbled across the Ashburner Inn. We figured we'd get a sandwich or some appetizers, typical bar stuff. When we arrived, we were greeted by a really nice dining room. It was bright, cheery and very clean. As we walked to our table, we noticed nearly everyone was eating pizza. When our waitress told us that it was half price pizza night, we understood why. The brick-oven baked pizzas on the surrounding tables looked good and the price was certainly right! So, we ordered 2 pies.

The pizzas were delicious. They were some of the best I've had in a long time. The crust was light and crispy and the variety of topping choice was great. Besides some of the basics like pepperoni, sausage, etc., they also have pizzas with prosciutto and roasted peppers, chicken and blue cheese, buffalo chicken, spinach and roast pork and others. We particularly like the Ashburner which had spinach, roasted red peppers, shredded mozzarella, buffalo mozzarella and prosciutto.

I'm sure the Ashburner Inn has other good food, but I will be back again for the pizza!"

review:vFT48fYbvXstdQxcEiDT8w,Review,,"My girlfriend and I were walking down State st. and decided to stop in for a drink.  I was denied access to entering due to the white polo shirt I was wearing. (Banana Republic white polo).  The shirt is very clean and I am a 53 yr old business owner.  I asked the hostess, about a gentleman I could see inside at a table with the exact same shirt on. !... She said he must of gotten in before her shift. OMG Really?  I basically thought this was lame and I have never been denied access to any establishment. We simply went next door and took our business elsewhere.  Im still shaking my head wondering what the hell happened. I will not ever attempt to get a drink there again even with a different shirt on. There lose."

review:3E0t-qHUMFOyLH2_WxZZ1w,Review,,"I checked out this place on the first morning it opened. I was glad to see that another business opened in Downtown area, where much more developments besides residentials are needed. However, it sucks that it's another chain coffee shop. =[

The decor is pretty nice, I guess it's because it's a new place, but the some things were questionable. I do like the fact that it has wifi capabilities that I can just walk down from home to get something to drink and be connected.

The coffee... well, it's ok. I had their house blend, and it tasted very sour. I'm not really into acidic coffees. My friend ordered  a cappunccino and it was descent. The froth was actually very impressive, but the espresso, not the best. However, their service is excellent.  so I'll go back and see how they've improved. 

BTW, they rost their own coffee beans, so if they're rosting them beans while you're there, watch out b/c all that aroma will get you WIRED for sure."

review:6ZCRkNbG6EdyJnASeKqfrQ,Review,,"I usually don't go out for tacos, but when I realized this franchised taco shop was locally based, I decided to give it a try.  I really liked that they had a variety of tacos available including a chili ground beef soft taco and a chicken soft taco.  I loaded them with what ever toppings they had and selected the 2nd of five heat sauces since I wanted some heat and flavor, but not too much that might override the taste.

The ingredients were fresh and the taco shells were sturdy enough to stay together while loaded.  

The amount of chili on the chili taco was minimal and was a bit disappointing.  The chicken version had a lot more meat, but it seemed like standard chicken deli meat, not seasoned like I might find at some other Mexican restaurants.  

The staff was friendly and fairly quick on building my meal, but they have very limited interaction other than calling your name when your order is ready.  

No tipping or busing of the tables by the staff seemed apparent.

Plenty of parking in the common lot of the strip mall.

Clean bathrooms. 

Parking is a bit tight off the street but a small handful more parking spots are available in the back.
Good lively location. 

Food: 
Quantity: extremely generous and very filling. 
Great healthy vegetarian options available

We got their made to order falafel and vegetarian wraps and what they call madd loaded falafel pita pizza - amazing! 
For appetizer we ordered their spicy greek feta cheese fries  - yummy  

And to top it off we shared Baklava Milk shake!! Surprisingly heavenly!! It's just like Baklava! Delicious, scrumptious with pieces of nuts and pistachios, with phyllo layers and honey, with ice cream and whipped cream topping! 
... every dessert lover's dream but not for so health conscious folks ... we indulged and we shared and yet we couldn't finish it! 

Customer service was extremely prompt and professional, friendly and they listened to your requests. They promptly refilled our beverages and were consistently checking in on us. 

Will go again! Great food and great option!"

review:7zJMuRLCcTe78mZhb2ngHg,Review,,"I'm so disappointed with my visit here. I visited Bacon Boss when they were on the grilled cheese festival. I was so looking forward to an amazing grilled cheese with some fries. After waiting for almost 45 minutes for my order to come out, I was so annoyed with waiting that the food wasn't even enjoyable. The grilled cheese was so tiny and totally something I could've made at home for $2. The fries weren't anything special and they didn't even have ketchup or anything to dip them in. The lady in the truck kept running out to tell the customers that they were running low. They should've been more than plenty stocked knowing how big of a crowd they were going to attract. Very disappointed."

Server forgot to ring in our order (didnt even apologize), then came to ask me what we had ordered (for a table of 3) so she could ring it in, waited another 45 mins, Food runners brought our food, then the server didnt bother to come quality check. No drink refills, and she let dirty plates sit on our table.

Waited a total of 2 and a half hours for lunch. Was supposed to be booking a company dinner  there for 20 people in the private room and will definitely NOT be doing so now. Its a shame as they are just down the road from our office."

One thing that works well is that they dedicated the end of the bar to walk up orders, so you don't have to worry too much about reaching past the bar seating.

Beer wise they seem to be playing it safe with a couple of standby options and focusing on the IPAs. The only real standout for me was the Sylvie porter, but the hopheads seem to like what they're doing too."

Only one dish was overly spicy, the rest were well seasoned for non-Indian eaters. The staff was friendly and helpful. The pricing was right for the quantity and quality. If you like traditional style Indian food that is not the burn your mouth off style, then this place is for you. Would definitely come back when in the area and would definitely recommend visiting if you are in downtown St. Louis. It is one of the best restaurants for quality and pricing in the area. Only drawback is that they are currently only open for lunch from 11:00-2:00, so make sure you hit their lunch window while they are open."

review:Sn_CFFZkgWOnhqlxQYC34w,Review,,"Finally got to Frankie's with the family. Kids had a cheeseburger and chicken fingers with fries. I personally sampled the Chicken - really good chicken. Turns out to be Red Bird chicken, organic. Both kids gave Frankie's 5-stars. Nancy had a Phili Cheese steak and loved it, hard for me to love this style as I much prefer the Chicago version.
I had the Alaskan Cod fish and chips. When I got mine I seriously though of vandekamp's fish sticks. I was surprised though, actual fish steak properly breaded and really fresh tasting.
We met Frankie, super nice guy. I asked him about the fish and he went into a nice story about how many he had to go through to get the quality he as looking for, and I appreciate that. They were fantastic, I just wish there were twice as many."

review:-LBq6ymWVY6ZF2_owiLlPA,Review,,This place was just what I needed. Walking around Philly late at night and we noticed this was one of a few places still serving food so we popped in. I had the build your own dog which was good. They have all types of different options for toppings and different meats to choose from. I played it safe with a regular beef dog. We also tried the artichoke and crab dip which was really good. The service was great and timely. A group at the bar was a little loud but it was no big deal. I'll definitely go back when I'm in town again.

Because I was so happy with the quality and service I was using them again for Super Bowl.  When I called to order I was given a woman's name and number to call for catering.  I called and left my name and number.  I never received a response.  Not only is this disrespectful it also would leave anyone to believe that Frankie's is not interested in customer service.  I was very disappointed because I was so happy with my previous experience.  I will never use them again and will encourage to do the same.

The service is incredibly slow, and the employees are not customer friendly. Cars routinely leave the drive through line after ordering because of the slowness, which causes great confusion. The kicker for me was, a few days after getting an awesome chicken sandwich at the Turnersville location, I went to this one and was given a limp, soggy, tasteless version of that sandwich. I can only suspect that it sat forever and they microwaved it. This location needs new management."

review:0k7Jay7sZIaRKw51OSs5Mg,Review,,"I've said it before and I'll say it again, Twisted Tree is my favorite steakhouse.  It's located on the side of a Holiday Inn on Lindberg down from another of their restaurants, Helen Fitzgerald's.  It would be a good idea if you made reservations.  They have a bar menu but you can order off of the regular menu if you are sitting at the bar.  Of course that's where we sat where Taylor and Tiffiny (?) took excellent care of us.

We decided to share the batter dipped lobster bites.  Four to an order and they were delicious.  They were served on top of shoestring potatoes and they were very good also.  I could have munched on them all night.  Now here is the best thing about Twisted Tree.  Where other steak restaurants serve everything ala carte, Twisted Tree doesn't.  Your entrée comes with a salad (regular or Caesar) and a side dish.  The salads are nice and fresh.

He decided to get the Kansas City strip and I got the 12 oz. prime rib with my side being a baked potato.  I can't remember what his side was because I was so involved with my food that I didn't even look.  My prime rib was the best prime rib I have ever had.  I will have a hard time when I come back here to not order this again.  We also decided on dessert - wedding cake. We ordered it with a scoop of ice cream and it was delicious also.

Would I come back here?   You better believe it. I'll see you in the funny pages."

review:tnvK0h8HwpIph-MXIrZ2_g,Review,,"It's conflicting to recommend this place for two reasons.  However, I will let you decide based on what you read. 

To start off, the burger prices are low for the smoking of food you get.  I ordered a double burger and I couldn't finish it. The burger tasted very good. If you've been to Texas, this burger slightly reminded me of Whataburger's hamburgers in terms of taste. 

I was given the choice between regular or spiced fries. I went with the spiced fries and they tasted between the Long John Silvers and Rally's/Checkers fries. Overall, the food was delicious and satisfying.

This next part, however, is where it gets hard to recommend the restaurant to just anyone. As I walked in, I was greeted to two employees who were joking around.  They were young, possible high school seniors or recent graduates. One wasn't wearing a mask and the other had a mask on but it was fully under her chin. Without masks, they approached the customer ahead of me to give her the food she was there to pick up. You could tell that customer felt uncomfortable getting the food from unmasked employees, but she didn't say anything about it.  I would have left if not for a friend who was set on eating here. 

I'm my order was handled by an older woman who was very friendly and knowledgeable about the food options. She wasn't wearing a mask either. Behind her, I could see employees in the kitchen engage in physical contact like slapping of the hands and more joking around without gloves and masks.  The burger is good, but is it worth ignoring what I witnessed, I'm not so sure."

review:yBiHbwloPPaN3fe3wHI7_g,Review,,"This place is probably as bad if not worse than the restaurant that was at this location before it. Our waitress checked on us once during our whole visit. When my pancakes arrived they were cold, not like it has been sitting out cold, but like they were kept in a refrigerator cold. I ordered the cinnamon roll pancakes and WARNING they come with strawberries Incase you don't like strawberries. Even the waitress didn't know they came with strawberries. I looked passed that because I do like strawberries but the whole dish was cold while the syrup they gave me was hot. 

I attempted to eat it anyways, but when I took a bite of my second strawberry it had a very rotten taste to it and I had to spit it out. I have never had to return food in my life. But I had to at this location. I waited 45 minutes for my food and when it arrived it was cold and the strawberries didn't even taste like strawberries. Worst experience at a restaurant I have ever had."

review:DjVn5hf4P2WGCsIIoNQtJg,Review,,"Best pizza I've ever had in my life. When it's not too busy the atmosphere is lovely. I've tried multiple pies & all were GOOD. You can't order wrong here. The crust is amazing. The ingredients are fresh and high quality. They're designation of origin certified for some of the pizzas!! I will agree the service kind of dips in quality when it's busy, but what can you expect at such a popular place in such a small space? My only real complaint has to do with the size of the meat and cheese board. It's delicious but seems to change in size depending on party size, without any price adjustment. While that's nice in a way, I also don't appreciate going out with my boyfriend and paying the same price I pay with my family but getting less food. I wish there was a standard size or at the very least a sizing options so I wasn't paying the same $12 for less food."

review:Cv3WzzV9Rxx3YOXDWT5FJw,Review,,"I had very high hopes about this place from its appearance on the Food Network and previous reviews. It's known for being a dive and I can appreciate that, however, this is past that. You have to park across the street and cross a busy road, which is ok, but definitely scary with little ones. There are a few tables outside but you can tell that there is no attention to that area. The tables were dirty (I doubt they ever get clean) and the ground was weeds and dirt; granted, its outside but a little attention could take that area from dirty to cute outdoorsy patio. 

For a walk up window, service is very slow. We waited about 15 minutes for a burger, sandwich and a hot dog. Not fun, entertaining hungry children just feet from a busy road. 

All that could be looked past if the food was amazing, it was not. It was very pricey considering. I didn't try the burger but for $10+ I expect a large and flavorful burger, but my husband ate it in a few bites and said the ones we make home are better. Disappointing. I had Reuben with onion rings. My reuben was good with a decent amount of meat, not overly memorable but also not bad. I ordered the onion rings which came with an upcharge of around $3... could not have been less worth it. I only had about 5 rings and they were covered in this spicy salty mix and very very greasy. Again, disappointing. 

For dessert, we will still feeling optimistic for their ""dairy bar"". That sounds to me like some fresh, homemade ice cream. Nope. $3 for a scoop of vanilla Blue Bell out of the carton. Again, very disappointing. 

We had high hopes for this establishment, it has a cute concept but we will not be returning. Overpriced for quality and taste."

review:YIXh5GB297HGItFLIpwT-A,Review,,"I think everyone's rating is close to the money. We came lured by the 7.99 breakfast buffet and they had a good variety, but we were super disappointed. Everything was cold, some things were very hard and the waffles had a weird after taste. The hash browns had hard instances and my cup was dirty with some goo. I would not recommend this place. Avoid it and go somewhere with quality food."
